# Business Site

I decided to create a site called dogGO for people wanting dog-friendly travel adventures. 

## The problem

I wanted my hero video to have a header nav and stay put while scrolling down to the FAQ and Sign Up form. However I was having trouble getting the video and header to place properly and it took a lot of googling before finding the solution in z-index property. 

I wish I could of worked more on the mobile view for this site but I was having trouble getting the video to turn off and the still image to turn on.
